# Image Text Extraction with Keras-OCR, Tesseract, and Preprocessing Tools

This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for extracting text from images using Keras-OCR and Tesseract, combined with preprocessing techniques powered by OpenCV and PIL (Python Imaging Library). The goal is to achieve robust text recognition even from noisy or poorly scanned images.

## Features

Keras-OCR: Optical character recognition for text extraction.

Tesseract and EasyOCR: OCR for enhanced accuracy in certain use cases.

OpenCV & PIL Preprocessing: Noise removal, resizing, and enhancing image quality for better OCR performance.

Flexible Pipeline: Easily switch between Keras-OCR and Tesseract.

Batch Processing: Process multiple images in one go.
